## Abstract

Our project, initiated by Group 10, tackles the substantial challenge of enhancing real-time collaborative efforts in document editing across different technological setups. By leveraging Markdown's simplicity and wide accessibility, we aimed to create a web application that supports seamless collaboration without the barriers often imposed by varying levels of technical expertise or device constraints.

## Introduction

In the realm of digital collaboration, most platforms support complex file formats that, while feature-rich, often compromise on portability and ease of use across different devices. Recognizing this gap, we turned to Markdownâ€”a straightforward format known for its accessibility and simplicity.

Our goal was to develop a web application that not only supports real-time collaborative editing but also democratizes the editing process, making it accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background. This application allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously, with changes reflected in real-time, enhancing communication and streamlining the collaborative process.

## Core Features

Our collaborative Markdown editor introduces several key features:
- **Real-time collaboration**: Allows multiple users to edit documents simultaneously and see each other's changes instantly.
- **Live preview**: Users can view a rendered version of the Markdown content as they type, ensuring that the document's format is preserved.
- **Robust access control**: Users can define who can view or edit documents, enhancing security and integrity.

## Architecture

The application is built on a multi-layered architecture:
- **Front-end**: Developed with React and JSX, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Proxy layer**: Implemented with TypeScript, it serves as an intermediary that enhances security and manages communication between the client and server.
- **Server layer**: Utilizes Node.js and TypeScript to handle business logic, with distinct components for user management and real-time document editing.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used for its flexibility in handling large volumes of unstructured data, essential for a scalable, modern web application.

Each layer is designed to optimize performance and user experience, ensuring that the application can handle the dynamic and collaborative nature of real-time editing.

## Technology Stack

- **React & JSX**: For a dynamic and responsive front-end.
- **Node.js & TypeScript**: For server-side logic, offering scalability and performance.
- **MongoDB**: Chosen for its NoSQL approach, allowing flexible, scalable database solutions.

## Communication and Synchronization

We implemented REST API for standard server-client communications and WebSocket for real-time, bidirectional interactions. For maintaining consistency across all clients, we utilized techniques like CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) and Lamport timestamps, which help in managing the sequence of operations without central coordination.

## Challenges and Learnings

Throughout this project, we faced several challenges:
- **Scalability**: Managing large numbers of users and documents while maintaining performance.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across distributed systems was crucial and challenging.
- **User Experience**: Balancing complexity and usability to cater to both technical and non-technical users.

From these challenges, we learned valuable lessons in distributed system design, real-time data synchronization, and creating user-centric applications that are both robust and easy to use.

## Conclusion

This project not only enhanced our understanding of real-time collaborative systems but also set a new standard for document editing tools. We are excited about its potential to improve productivity and collaboration across various sectors.

We believe this technology can be the cornerstone of future advancements in collaborative software. Thank you for following our journey, and we hope our project inspires further innovation in this space.
