# My Journey with Neovim

Welcome to my blog! Today, I want to share my personal journey with Neovim, how I struggled through the initial phases, and how this experience has shaped my development skills and preferences.

## 1. How I Started Neovim

My journey began out of necessity. My laptop, a PS42 MSI, struggled with performance issues on Windows. Frequent crashes in Visual Studio Code were common due to the laptop's limitations, and upgrading my hardware wasn't financially feasible. Seeking an alternative, I turned to Linux. This switch was not just a change of operating system; it introduced me to Neovim, marking a significant turn in my development journey.

## 2. Struggles

### Adapting to Linux

Switching to Linux was like learning to swim by being thrown into the deep end. For basic tasks, it felt similar to Windows, but the real challenge emerged when I began using it as a developer. Linux, with all its power, brought complexity. I found myself reinstalling the OS three times; twice because I mismanaged the disk partitions, and once, a fatal mistake where I accidentally ran `sudo rm -rf` on my root directory.

### Mastering Neovim

The transition to Neovim was another hurdle. Coming from a "mouse-centric" world, adapting to Neovim's keyboard-focused interface was daunting. The initial setup and customization process was completely different from anything I had experienced.

## 3. Growth

Despite the struggles, there was a light at the end of the tunnel—Primeagen's tutorials. These guides helped me see the potential of keyboard-driven development. I gradually stopped relying on the mouse for coding, and my customization sessions with Neovim became more about enjoyment than necessity. I even added vim-like navigation to my browser. Now, Linux isn’t just an alternative but my preferred OS, and the thought of going back to Windows is unimaginable.

## Conclusion

My journey with Neovim and Linux has been full of challenges and learning. It's reshaped how I interact with my computer and how I think about development work. For those considering a similar switch, be prepared for a steep learning curve, but also for significant growth and satisfaction.

Thank you for reading, and I hope my story inspires you to explore beyond your comfort zone.
