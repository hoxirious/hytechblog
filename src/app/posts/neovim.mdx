# My Journey with Neovim: A Developer's Odyssey

## 1. How I Started with Neovim

My journey with Neovim began as a quest for efficiency and performance. Frustrated by the underperformance of my MSI PS42 laptop on Windows and constant crashes of VSCode, I found myself at a crossroads. With limited resources to upgrade my hardware, I decided to explore alternative options. This led me to the world of Linux, where Neovim became an integral part of my development journey.

## 2. Struggles: A Path Paved with Challenges

Transitioning to Linux initially seemed like a natural choice, but the reality of its complexities soon became apparent. While it served as a basic operating system, unleashing its true potential for development purposes proved to be a daunting task. I encountered numerous hurdles along the way, including the infamous reinstallation of the OS three times. My first two attempts were marred by incorrect disk partitioning, while the third was a result of an unfortunate mishap involving a `sudo rm -rf` command on my root directory.

Additionally, embracing Neovim presented its own set of challenges. From the initial setup to adapting to a completely different workflow devoid of the comfort of a mouse, the learning curve was steep. However, these struggles ultimately became the catalyst for growth and transformation.

## 3. Growth: Illumination Amidst Darkness

Amidst the chaos and frustration, a ray of light emerged in the form of Primegeance. This pivotal moment marked a turning point in my Neovim journey. With newfound determination, I immersed myself in the intricacies of Neovim, spending countless hours customizing it to suit my workflow. What was once a source of struggle transformed into a labor of love, as I found solace in the art of optimization and efficiency.

Gradually, I bid farewell to the reliance on the mouse and embraced the elegance of Neovim's modal editing. Its seamless integration into my development workflow revolutionized the way I approached coding tasks. No longer tethered to the constraints of traditional IDEs, I found liberation in the simplicity and power of Neovim.

Today, Linux stands as my primary operating system, and the mere thought of returning to Windows fills me with apprehension. Neovim has become more than just a text editor; it's a testament to resilience, growth, and the unwavering pursuit of excellence in the world of software development.
