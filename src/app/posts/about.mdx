# Hello there!ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal blog! I'm excited to share my journey from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to becoming a final-year Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary. Here's my story.

## 1. Background

Hello! I'm a proud Vietnamese, originally from Ho Chi Minh City. My adventure abroad began after grade 10 when I moved to Red Deer, Canada. I completed my high school at Hunting Hills High School, graduating in the top 10% of my class, and then moved to Calgary for my post-secondary education. Fast forward a few years, I am now in my final year at the University of Calgary, eagerly looking forward to stepping into the professional world.

## 2. How I Started My Career

Contrary to what might have been expected given my family background, with no ties to the tech industry, I was initially inclined towards teaching or possibly even becoming a master of ceremonies, as my best friend Khoa Nguyen often suggested. However, choosing engineering was a practical decision initiallyâ€”deemed the safest bet. Yet, it wasn't until after completing my first year that I discovered my true passion for software engineering. Software stood out to me because it offered the freedom to experiment and innovate without the high costs or risks associated with fields like civil or mechanical engineering.

The real turning point came when I met my mentorsâ€”an Duc Phan, Tuan Pham, Minh Nguyen, and Viâ€”who I affectionately consider my big brothers. They guided me through the early stages of my career. My first project was the [True Love Machine](https://github.com/hoxirious/TrueLoveMachine), a simple app written in Java that, looking back, was quite rough around the edges but a source of immense pride at the time. Duc, in particular, played a pivotal role as he mentored me and Khoa, even trusting us to contribute to a product from his company, Apheleia. His mentorship was invaluable, laying the foundation for my skills in TypeScript, web development, and clean code. Inspired by him, I even modeled my website after hisâ€”check out his incredible work at [Duc's website](https://duc-duchy.io/).

This experience helped me secure an internship at Energy Toolbase, where I learned invaluable real-life lessons. Although I wish I could return there after graduation, I understand that it's time to explore new opportunities.

## 3. How I Developed

I believe in never resting on my laurels. During my internship, I spent my evenings catching up with new technologies. One notable endeavor was beginning to learn Rust, a language known for its safety and performance (checkout this [personal project](posts/keyboard-mapper) if you haven't). This exploration not only expanded my technical skills but also my approach to problem-solving in software development. Check out this [personal project](posts/keyboard-mapper) where I applied my Rust knowledge. Additionally, I continued to deepen my understanding with tools like [Neovim](posts/neovim).

Post-internship, returning to university, I delved into Big Data, Distributed Systems, and Compiler Theoryâ€”each subject building my expertise and readiness for the industry.

## 4. Next Steps

As I approach the completion of my degree, I am eager to apply my accumulated knowledge and experience in the real world. I am looking for opportunities that will challenge me and allow me to contribute meaningfully to the field of software engineering.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my journey. I am excited for what the future holds and am looking for opportunities where I can make a significant impact. Let's connect!
