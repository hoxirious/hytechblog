# My Journey: From lost kid to Software Engineering

## 1. Background

As my name suggests, I hail from the vibrant city of Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam. However, my journey took an unexpected turn when I ventured to Canada after completing grade 10. Red Deer welcomed me as my first Canadian home, where I graduated from Hunting Hills High School, ranking among the top 10% of my peers. Subsequently, I pursued my passion for software engineering at the University of Calgary, where I currently find myself in the final year of my studies, eagerly anticipating the next chapter in my career.

## 2. How I Started the Career

Although my parents had no affiliation with the tech industry, destiny had other plans for me. Initially drawn to engineering as a safe bet due to my proficiency in STEM subjects, it wasn't until after my first year that I discovered my true passion lies in software development. The allure of creating something extraordinary from mere lines of code captivated me, leading me to pursue software engineering wholeheartedly.

My journey truly began when I crossed paths with inspirational figures like Anh Duc Phan, Anh Tuan Pham, Anh Minh Nguyen, and Anh Vi. Their mentorship and guidance played a pivotal role in shaping my trajectory in this field. My first foray into app development, the [True Love Machine](https://github.com/hoxirious/TrueLoveMachine) written in Java, may seem amateurish in hindsight, but it ignited a spark of enthusiasm within me. Anh Duc Phan's unwavering support and mentorship paved the way for my growth, from developing projects for Apheleia to honing my skills in TypeScript and web development.

Embarking on an internship at Energy Toolbase provided invaluable real-world experience, further solidifying my passion for software engineering. Although I cherish the lessons learned during my time there, I'm now poised to explore new opportunities and expand my horizons.

## 3. How I Developed

A relentless pursuit of growth and learning defines my approach to personal and professional development. Even amidst the demands of my internship, I dedicated myself to expanding my skill set by delving into technologies like Rust (checkout this [personal project](/posts/keyboard-mapper)) a and exploring tools such as [Neovim](/posts/neovim). Back at university, my thirst for knowledge led me to delve into subjects like Big Data, Distributed Systems, and Compiler Design, enriching my understanding and preparing me for the challenges ahead.

## 4. Next Step

Armed with a wealth of experience and knowledge accumulated over the years, my next step is to apply my expertise to make a tangible impact on the world. I'm eager to leverage my skills to tackle new challenges and contribute to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of technology and innovation.

As I embark on this next chapter of my journey, I remain grateful for the support and guidance that have propelled me forward. With determination and passion as my compass, I eagerly anticipate the opportunities and adventures that lie ahead in the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering.
